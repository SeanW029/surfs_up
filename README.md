## Overview of the statistical analysis:

To help client collect, sort and present information about temperature trends from a raw temperature database for the months of June and December in Oahu, before opening the surf shop  in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

* mean temperatures in June and December are 74.944118 and 71.041529 F
* throughout the entire June temperature has never dropped below 73 F whereas in December 25% of time temperature will drop to 69 F and other times remain abouve 71 F
* maximun temperature in June and December does not differ much with a swing of 2 F

## Summary:

From the analytic result we could tell that temperature does not fluctuate too wildly in Oahu between June and December, with similar maximum temperature and month round average temperature. However, 25% time of December temperature will drop to around 69 F, and that might create a little uncertainty to the demand of surfing and ice-cream. We could perform two more queries on sea water temperature and wind chill factor to dig out more information to help client with his business decision making.
